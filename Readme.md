# node-webaudio

This is an attempt at making an implementation of the Web Audio API (as found in Chrome) for Node.js. 

Right now the priority is to get the PortAudio library working in Node.js.

### Development Instructions

You'll need to install PortAudio, which you can do from source (which is what I did) or with MacPorts.  After that, 
you should be good to go.
